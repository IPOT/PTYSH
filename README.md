# PTYSH
PTYSH is an abbreviation of 'Python Teletype Shell'.

It was made with reference to the zebra vtysh.

Vtysh is an integrated shell for Quagga routing software.

Ptysh is not the only route shell, the shell is customizable, so you can normally use.

It made it possible to add commands to the module for availability.
